"""Mutation kill check: prove the Direct Mode suite pins each load-bearing
guard, not merely that the code passes today.

For each mutation the repository is copied to a scratch directory with ONE
guard in the contract mechanically broken, and the whole Direct Mode suite
runs against the copy. A mutation is KILLED when the suite fails and SURVIVED
when it passes (an unpinned guard). The run starts with an accept-control:
the unmodified copy must pass, or every kill would be vacuous.

Anchors are code TEXT, never line numbers. An anchor that is not found
exactly once is reported as ANCHOR MISSING - the guard moved or was deleted,
which is its own finding.

Run:  python scripts/mutation_check.py              (full sweep)
      python scripts/mutation_check.py --anchors    (anchor check only)
      python scripts/mutation_check.py --only gate  (names containing "gate";
                                                     separate several with |)
